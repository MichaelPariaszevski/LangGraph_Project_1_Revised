This essay examines the influence of a mandatory school-uniform dress code on academic achievement and discipline infractions. In addition, student gender and type of school district were compared to show the influence of this policy. Only schools that implemented a mandatory school-uniform policy in 1996 and had data for discipline infractions and academic achievement for the 1995-96 and 1996-97 school years were eligible for inclusion in the study. Subjects consisted of students in a southern Florida school district located in a predominately rural area. The final sample included 6 middle schools and 80 elementary schools from 2 school districts. Results show that elementary-school students in both rural and urban school districts demonstrated improvement in academic achievement for the first year following the implementation of the school-uniform policy. The discipline infractions of out-of-school suspensions and juvenile referrals had a statistically significant improvement. Middle-school students did not have a significant decrease for discipline infractions for the school year 1996-97. The numbers of students not promoted to the next grade showed a significant effect by district type but not by gender. Further research is needed on the importance of dress to influence educators as they help students achieve a healthier self-esteem. (Contains 15 references.)

To counter this,\\nWHO has taken a number of actions with tech companies to remain one step ahead.  \\n   Changing social media policy and guidelines    WHO works with social media policy departments to ensure company policy and guidelines for content providers are fit for purpose. For example, WHO worked with YouTube to enhance their COVID-19 Misinformation Policy and provide guidelines for content providers\\nto ensure no medical misinformation related to the virus proliferates on their platform. Policy updates such as this have led to the removal of 850,000 YouTube videos related to harmful or misleading COVID-19 misinformation from February 2020 to January\\n2021.   \\n \\n   Reporting Misinformation     Social media platforms have also granted WHO access to fast track reporting systems, which allows us to flag misinformation on their platforms, speeding up the reporting and removal of content that breaks policy. WHO also works with Member States such\\nas the Government of the United Kingdom to raise awareness of misinformation around COVID-19 and vaccines, and encourage individuals to report false or misleading content online.   \\n   Leveraging data insights     On a weekly basis, WHO works with YouTube, Google, Facebook and several other partners such as NewsGuard to obtain industry-leading insights that help identify burgeoning misinformation and subsequently allows WHO to target science-based health information\\nwhere it’s needed most.\\n\\nSource URL: \\n\\nhttps://www.who.int/teams/digital-health-and-innovation/digital-channels/combatting-misinformation-online\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n', 'Information from source 2:\\n\\nYou are growing up in a world where social media has always been a part of connecting with others, especially friends and classmates. Social media has made it possible to stay connected to other people from almost anywhere and at any time.\\nHowever, digital platforms can also make things more difficult for you emotionally. It’s important to recognize when patterns of social media use are unhelpful and understand the potential consequences.\\nLearning People Skills\\nHave you ever noticed how intensely babies look at the faces of people around them? Our brains are wired to use our senses to connect with others; by seeing their facial expressions, hearing their tone of voice and noticing their reactions as we speak, we learn important social cues and effective communication habits.\\nIt is a complicated and ongoing learning process that can be negatively impacted by social media. If the majority of your interactions with others are coming through a screen or in written messages, especially when you are young and your brain is still developing, you may be missing out on opportunities to improve your people skills through face-to-face communication.\\nOnline Bullying\\nYou are most likely aware that sometimes people behave or interact online in ways they would not in person. This might include bullying, using offensive or insulting language or other hurtful behaviors. When this behavior happens on social media, it is generally viewed and even shared widely — making it difficult to reduce its impact.\\nIf this happens to you, it’s understandable to feel hurt or down about it. To stop the bullying from continuing, it’s important to report what’s happening — both on the social media platform you are using and to let an adult that you trust know about it.\\nComparing Ourselves to Others\\nPeople often present unrealistic or adjusted images of themselves and their lives on social media. They may only share the fun and exciting aspects of their lives, never mentioning any of their private struggles — or they may digitally edit photos to hide things they perceive as flaws. Constantly viewing these idealized depictions can lead to feeling competitive and/or unhappy if we try to compare ourselves to these images that may not be realistic.\\nIsolation\\nResearch has shown that people who spend more time on social media and less time in personal interactions with others have an increased risk of feeling anxious and depressed. However, it’s difficult to know which came first: if spending time online causes anxiety and depression or if young people who are depressed and anxious are more likely to be isolated, less active and spending time on social media. In either case, too much time online and too little time with others can have a negative impact on our mental health.\\nSuggestions for Protecting Your Mental Health\\nHere are a few suggestions to maintain your mental health while using social media:\\nLimit your time on social media platforms. Some platforms, such as Apple and Google, have settings to help you do this automatically on your phone.\\nConsider what sites and profiles you visit; if they make you feel bad, unfollow them\\nBefore you post something about yourself or someone else, consider if you would make this comment in an in-person setting\\nRemember that what you post will be very hard to take back or remove\\nRemember that what people post, or what you see, may not be honest or real presentations of their experiences or lives\\nLeave or unfollow a profile/page/site if it is making you feel worse\\nReport posts that are hurtful or making you worried\\nTell an adult you trust — a parent, teacher, school counselor — immediately if a friend is posting content that worries you or suggests that they may be in a serious situation\\n||||I||||\\nSkip to content\\nSearch Close Menu\\n* Sign In\\n* About Mental Illness\\nWays of Giving\\nExplore the different options for supporting NAMI\\'s mission.\\nLearn

People spend ever more time on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and others – but many forget (or are not concerned at all) about their privacy. Having presence on Internet ultimately builds a digital identity that is often different than the real person. Because your identity and image could be at stake, I have compiled this checklist to help you protect your privacy while indulging in social media.   Decide if your digital presence and persona is professional or individual – Having professional content in social media can assist your mission in carrier and business, while over-sharing personal data can trigger opposite effect.  Be aware of who you are sharing your information with – Customizing your settings in a way that you’re keeping strangers out and only sharing your information, posts and pictures with people in your inner circle goes a long way in protecting your privacy. Most websites will also give you the option to group friends into different categories, each of which gives you the option to limit or edit the kind of information shared. It’s advisable to take advantage of this option when available.   Remove any traces of yourself from Public Searches – Some websites grant you the ability to keep your profile from being found through a public search engine. If you’d like to remain hidden, look for this option to ensure you activate it. Many can find you easily just by your phone number.  Opt-out of check-ins – Many websites and apps allow you to check-in to geographic locations. Plenty of users don’t mind this option, while many actually choose to check-in publicly to let others know where they are. Remember however, that when you do tell others where you are, you’re also telling them where you aren’t – at home. Criminals can keep track of your activity to pick a time when you aren’t home and break-in. I recommend not checking in publicly.  Keep a close eye on social apps – There are plenty of apps which have access to your friends list, posts, pictures and other information. Manually editing the app privacy settings, either within the social website or each app individually on your phone to remove these intrusive permissions will help. I, for example, periodically go through my connected apps and remove the ones I no longer use.  Limit the amount of personal information you post – Personal information posted on public domains leaves you vulnerable. Abstaining from posting information such as your birth date, physical address among other details will keep away those meddling identity thieves. If you have friends and family posting information about you, ensure that it is information you are comfortable with strangers knowing about and nothing more.  Be wary of strangers – The internet makes it entirely easy for people to pose as someone they aren’t – misrepresenting their identities and motives. Consider privacy controls which limit the people who are allowed to contact you on social websites. When you interact with people you do not know, be careful with the amount of your personal information you reveal or even agreeing to meet a stranger in person.  Stay updated on Privacy Policy Changes on websites and Apps – Privacy policies are known to change frequently in social media websites so make sure you are aware of the policies and are regularly notified when updates happen. Reviewing your privacy settings often is also recommended.  What you need to build is a solid social media hygiene, where you are fully in control of how others see you in social media. At the end, you drive the destiny of your digital identity.       ||||I|||| CALL TODAY! +1 212 222 7061\\n* Home\\n* Contact Us\\n* Blog\\n* 24×7 Cyber 911 Response\\nReport incident\\n* IR & Forensics\\n+ Digital Forensics Services\\n+ Cyber Incident Response Retainer\\n+ Cyber Incident Response\\n+ Data Breach Response\\n+ Digital Forensics\\n+ Ransomware Response\\n+ Bitcoin Payments\\n* Proactive Security\\n+ Proactive Cyber Defense Services\\n+ Managed Threat Hunting & Response\\n+ Remote Cybersecurity Suite\\n+ The Daily T.R.U.T.H.\\n+ Remote Worker Cyber Resilience\\n+ Post Ransomware Threat Hunting Services\\n+ Cyber Threat Hunting\\n+ Penetration Testing\\n+ Secure Code Review\\n+ Phishing Attack Simulation\\n+ Managed Detection and Response\\n+ Ransomware Protection Package\\n+ Business Email Compromise\\n* Advisory\\n+ Cybersecurity Advisory Services\\n+ CISO as a Service\\n+ Gap Assessment\\n+ Cyber Resilience & Response\\n+ Compliance Advisory\\n+ Cloud Security Advisory\\n+ Project Management as a Service (PMaaS)\\n+ Tabletop Exercises\\n+ Cyber Resiliency Training\\n* SecurityScorecard\\n+ Request a Demo\\n+ Security Data\\n+ Security Ratings\\n+ Market Place\\n+ Security Assessments\\n* Resources\\n+ Case Studies\\n+ Technical Tools\\n+ Technical Guides\\n+ White Papers\\n+ Cyber Interviews, Tips & FAQ\\n* Company\\n+ About LIFARS\\n+ About SecurityScorecard\\n+ Notable Cases and Evidence Contribution\\n+ Meet the Team\\n+ Clients Advisory Board\\n+ LISIRT – Computer Security IR Team\\n+ Cyber Alliances\\n+ Insurance Panels\\n+ Cyber Events & Webinars\\n+ Cyber Press Room\\n+ Career in CyberSecurity\\n+ Cyber Security Training Videos\\n+ LIFARS SMS Alerts\\n+ Hackbits Podcast\\nExpert Tips: Privacy on Social Media\\n05/29/15\\nSocial media have taken over the Internet.
