This essay examines the influence of a mandatory school-uniform dress code on academic achievement and discipline infractions. In addition, student gender and type of school district were compared to show the influence of this policy. Only schools that implemented a mandatory school-uniform policy in 1996 and had data for discipline infractions and academic achievement for the 1995-96 and 1996-97 school years were eligible for inclusion in the study. Subjects consisted of students in a southern Florida school district located in a predominately rural area. The final sample included 6 middle schools and 80 elementary schools from 2 school districts. Results show that elementary-school students in both rural and urban school districts demonstrated improvement in academic achievement for the first year following the implementation of the school-uniform policy. The discipline infractions of out-of-school suspensions and juvenile referrals had a statistically significant improvement. Middle-school students did not have a significant decrease for discipline infractions for the school year 1996-97.

Social media has made it possible to stay connected to other people from almost anywhere and at any time.\\nHowever, digital platforms can also make things more difficult for you emotionally. It’s important to recognize when patterns of social media use are unhelpful and understand the potential consequences.\\nLearning People Skills\\nHave you ever noticed how intensely babies look at the faces of people around them? Our brains are wired to use our senses to connect with others; by seeing their facial expressions, hearing their tone of voice and noticing their reactions as we speak, we learn important social cues and effective communication habits.\\nIt is a complicated and ongoing learning process that can be negatively impacted by social media. If the majority of your interactions with others are coming through a screen or in written messages, especially when you are young and your brain is still developing, you may be missing out on opportunities to improve your people skills through face-to-face communication.\\nOnline Bullying\\nYou are most likely aware that sometimes people behave or interact online in ways they would not in person. This might include bullying, using offensive or insulting language or other hurtful behaviors. When this behavior happens on social media, it is generally viewed and even shared widely — making it difficult to reduce its impact.\\nIf this happens to you, it’s understandable to feel hurt or down about it. To stop the bullying from continuing, it’s important to report what’s happening — both on the social media platform you are using and to let an adult that you trust know about it.\\nComparing Ourselves to Others\\nPeople often present unrealistic or adjusted images of themselves and their lives on social media. They may only share the fun and exciting aspects of their lives, never mentioning any of their private struggles — or they may digitally edit photos to hide things they perceive as flaws. Constantly viewing these idealized depictions can lead to feeling competitive and/or unhappy if we try to compare ourselves to these images that may not be realistic.\\nIsolation\\nResearch has shown that people who spend more time on social media and less time in personal interactions with others have an increased risk of feeling anxious and depressed. However, it’s difficult to know which came first: if spending time online causes anxiety and depression or if young people who are depressed and anxious are more likely to be isolated, less active and spending time on social media. In either case, too much time online and too little time with others can have a negative impact on our mental health.\\nSuggestions for Protecting Your Mental Health\\nHere are a few suggestions to maintain your mental health while using social media:\\nLimit your time on social media platforms. Some platforms, such as Apple and Google, have settings to help you do this automatically on your phone.\\nConsider what sites and profiles you visit; if they make you feel bad, unfollow them\\nBefore you post something about yourself or someone else, consider if you would make this comment in an in-person setting\\nRemember that what you post will be very hard to take back or remove\\nRemember that what people post, or what you see, may not be honest or real presentations of their experiences or lives\\nLeave or unfollow a profile/page/site if it is making you feel worse\\nReport posts that are hurtful or making you worried\\nTell an adult you trust — a parent, teacher, school counselor — immediately if a friend is posting content that worries you or suggests that they may be in a serious situation\\n||||I||||\\nSkip to content\\nSearch Close Menu\\n* Sign In\\n* About Mental Illness\\nWays of Giving\\nExplore the different options for supporting NAMI\\'s mission.\\nLearn

where social media has always been a part of connecting with others, especially friends and classmates. Social media has made it possible to stay connected to other people from almost anywhere and at any time.\\nHowever, digital platforms can also make things more difficult for you emotionally. It’s important to recognize when patterns of social media use are unhelpful and understand the potential consequences.\\nLearning People Skills\\nHave you ever noticed how intensely babies look at the faces of people around them? Our brains are wired to use our senses to connect with others; by seeing their facial expressions, hearing their tone of voice and noticing their reactions as we speak, we learn important social cues and effective communication habits.\\nIt is a complicated and ongoing learning process that can be negatively impacted by social media. If the majority of your interactions with others are coming through a screen or in written messages, especially when you are young and your brain is still developing, you may be missing out on opportunities to improve your people skills through face-to-face communication.\\nOnline Bullying\\nYou are most likely aware that sometimes people behave or interact online in ways they would not in person. This might include bullying, using offensive or insulting language or other hurtful behaviors. When this behavior happens on social media, it is generally viewed and even shared widely — making it difficult to reduce its impact.\\nIf this happens to you, it’s understandable to feel hurt or down about it. To stop the bullying from continuing, it’s important to report what’s happening — both on the social media platform you are using and to let an adult that you trust know about it.\\nComparing Ourselves to Others\\nPeople often present unrealistic or adjusted images of themselves and their lives on social media. They may only share the fun and exciting aspects of their lives, never mentioning any of their private struggles — or they may digitally edit photos to hide things they perceive as flaws. Constantly viewing these idealized depictions can lead to feeling competitive and/or unhappy if we try to compare ourselves to these images that may not be realistic.\\nIsolation\\nResearch has shown that people who spend more time on social media and less time in personal interactions with others have an increased risk of feeling anxious and depressed. However, it’s difficult to know which came first: if spending time online causes anxiety and depression or if young people who are depressed and anxious are more likely to be isolated, less active and spending time on social media. In either case, too much time online and too little time with others can have a negative impact on our mental health.\\nSuggestions for Protecting Your Mental Health\\nHere are a few suggestions to maintain your mental health while using social media:\\n* Limit your time on social media platforms. Some platforms, such as Apple and Google, have settings to help you do this automatically on your phone.\\n* Consider what sites and profiles you visit; if they make you feel bad, unfollow them\\n* Before you post something about yourself or someone else, consider if you would make this comment in an in-person setting\\n* Remember that what you post will be very hard to take back or remove\\n* Remember that what people post, or what you see, may not be honest or real presentations of their experiences or lives\\n* Leave or unfollow a profile/page/site if it is making you feel worse\\n* Report posts that are hurtful or making you worried\\n* Tell an adult you trust — a parent, teacher, school counselor — immediately if a friend is posting content that worries you or suggests that they may be in a serious situation\\nCall or text the NAMI Helpline at 800-950-6264,\\nor chat with us, M-F, 10 a.m. - 10 p.m. ET.\\nIn a crisis?

No algorithms or ads to waste your time. Follow anyone across any Mastodon server from a single account and receive their posts in chronological order, and make your corner of the internet a little more like you.  Learn more            Build your audience in confidence Mastodon provides you with a unique possibility of managing your audience without middlemen. Mastodon deployed on your own infrastructure allows you to follow and be followed from any other Mastodon server online and is under no one's control but yours.  Learn more            Moderating the way it should be Mastodon puts decision making back in your hands. Each server creates their own rules and regulations, which are enforced locally and not top-down like corporate social media, making it the most flexible in responding to the needs of different groups of people. Join a server with the rules you agree with, or host your own.  Find a server            Unparalleled creativity Mastodon supports audio, video and picture posts, accessibility descriptions, polls, content warnings, animated avatars, custom emojis, thumbnail crop control, and more, to help you express yourself online. Whether you're publishing your art, your music, or your podcast, Mastodon is there for you.  Learn more      Why Mastodon?          Decentralized Instant global communication is too important to belong to one company. Each Mastodon server is a completely independent entity, able to interoperate with others to form one global social network.           Open Source Mastodon is free and open-source software. We believe in your right to use, copy, study and change Mastodon as you see fit, and we benefit from contributions from the community.           Not for Sale We respect your agency. Your feed is curated and created by you. We will never serve ads or push profiles for you to see. That means your data and your time are yours and yours alone.           Interoperable Built on open web protocols, Mastodon can speak with any other platform that implements ActivityPub. With one account you get access to a whole universe of social apps—the fediverse.      What our users are saying         I've made so many friends on Mastodon because I can actually talk to people instead of getting buried by algorithms that reward meaningless numbers over actual interaction.  infinite love ⴳ @trwnh@mastodon.social          Mastodon does an amazing job at giving communities the autonomy necessary to thrive by giving them the keys to federate and moderate their own servers. But don't let that alone overshadow the fact that it simply does features that the major social networks try to do (e.g. image captioning, content warnings) astoundingly better.  Jenn Schiffer @jenn@pixel.kitchen          Mastodon has changed my opinion of social media, it's a refreshing take on microblogging with a focus on privacy and safety.  dansup @dansup@mastodon.social          I've been on federated platforms since 2008. Mastodon is the best iteration of federated platforms with a user interface that is pleasant to use and a community of folks that I consider friends.  Craig Maloney @craigmaloney@octodon.social          Mastodon is a privacy-friendly way to communicate with people which are interested in my work and the work of my authority. social.bund.de gives us the opportunity to incubate Mastodon accounts even for other federal authorities.  Ulrich Kelber @ulrichkelber@bonn.social          Mastodon allowed us to create a non-profit, abuse-free social network based on open web standards and principles, all the while allowing our moderators and members to reinvigorate the early web values of community, camaraderie and respect using modern, accessible technologies.  Jaz @jaz@toot.wales          Mastodon is a well-moderated fully-functional microblogging service with some great features!  해파리 @jarm@qdon.space          It's social media with moderation that actually works.  voronoi potato @Vopo@mastodon.social          I could have joined an existing community, but I decided to self-host Mastodon.My posts to the world are replicated from my own servers and can be traced back to their originals. Since I own it, the platform will not be terminated or removed at the platform's discretion, and I can provide a long and stable service. I finally have this. Yay!  のえる @noellabo@fedibird.com          It's good software  halcy @halcy@icosahedron.website          Great community, friendly atmosphere, and free software! What else would you possibly need?  autumncheney @AutumnCheney@mastodon.social          I wanted to have a federated social network since 2013 that looked and felt great and where I can connect to like-minded people. Mastodon just gave me the last puzzle piece and I absolutely love it! Probably spend more than five hours a day on my own little space with a friendly community that truly cares.  Leonie @koyu@kopimi.space          I'm personally addicted to Mastodon, for me it's like if Facebook or Twitter had a friendly version— where I can discuss things with people around the world about every single thing they love. If there's a subreddit for everything, of course there's also a Mastodon community for everything: I've got one profile for sharing art, another one for casual conversation and another one for politics.  guedes @guedes@mastodon.social              Independent always Mastodon is free and open-source software developed by a non-profit organization. Public support directly sustains development and evolution.   Supported by Sponsorship does not equal influence.
